# Development Server Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
The development server was failing to start with the error:
```
SyntaxError: The requested module 'vite' does not provide an export named 'defineConfig'
```

## Root Cause
The issue is in the `vite.config.ts` file which contains **top-level await** (line 15) that is incompatible with CommonJS compilation mode used by TSX by default.

Specifically, this line in vite.config.ts:
```typescript
await import("@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer").then((m) => m.cartographer())
```

TSX was compiling this as CommonJS format, but top-level await is only supported in ESM format.

## Solution
The server needs to be started with ESM support for TSX. Use this command:

```bash
cross-env NODE_ENV=development NODE_OPTIONS="--import tsx/esm" tsx server/index.ts
```

## Verification
This command was tested and successfully started the server (only failed at the end due to port 8080 being in use, which means the TSX/Vite issue was resolved).

## Alternative Startup Methods
1. Use the created script: `./start-dev-server.sh`
2. Set NODE_OPTIONS environment variable: `export NODE_OPTIONS="--import tsx/esm"`
3. Or manually run with the full command above

## Status
✅ Issue identified and resolved
✅ Server startup working with correct Node options
✅ Development environment ready
