 Review and update the "Create Package" page in the admin panel to match the layout and user experience of the /sailing-cruise page. Only make adjustments if a feature is missing.

Review & Adjustment Checklist:
Short Description:
Check for a field to add a short description that displays in the package overview. If missing, add it in its designated spot.

Duration:
Ensure there's a field to set the tour duration (e.g., number of days/nights). Add if missing.

Language:
Check for a dropdown to select language; add it if not available.

Group Size:
Make sure there's a way to define max group size. Add the field if it's missing.

Starting Price:
There should be a visible field for the Base Price.

Location:
Check for input or selector for routes like “Cairo to Aswan.” Add if it doesn’t exist.

Tour Overview:
The overview field should be connected to a list of stored tours. The admin must be able to select from a Tours dropdown.

Best Time to Visit:
Add this field if not already present.

Ideal For:
There should be a selector for categories like families, couples, solo travelers. Add if needed.

What to Pack:
If missing, add the ability to input items with matching icons (Font Awesome) and tooltips for each.

Itinerary Sample:
The admin should be able to add itinerary entries per day, with text and optional images.

Room Types & Prices:
If not already linked to the rooms database, ensure prices and room types are fetched and shown dynamically.

Hotel Option:
Check for a hotel selection field in panel > package Creation > hotel. Include default examples like “Cairo Oasis Hotel or similar.”

Included / Excluded:
Verify the presence of input areas for what's included and excluded in the package.

There should be a map element where the route can be pinned (same as in /sailing-cruise). Add if not present.

Accommodation Highlights:
Add this section separately using icons and styles similar to the /sailing-cruise page.

Transportation:
Check for a dropdown to choose transportation options from a predefined list.
Each transport mode should have a price tied to it, and it must be calculated into the final package total automatically.
