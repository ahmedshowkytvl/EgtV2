Implement a dynamic City & Airport selection system for both "From" and "To" fields with the following specifications:

1. Grouped Dropdown Structure:
Each dropdown (From and To) should display a grouped, searchable list of Cities.

Under each city group, list its corresponding Airports.

Example format:

diff
Copy
Edit
-- Cairo, Egypt  
   Cairo International Airport  
   Almaza Airport  

-- Alexandria, Egypt  
   Borg El Arab Airport  
2. Search Behavior:
Users can type any part of a City or Airport name (e.g., "Cairo", "Borj", "Almaza") and all relevant matches should appear.

Matching results should include both airport names and the cities they belong to.

Selecting an airport should highlight it under its corresponding city.

3. Selection Output:
When an airport is selected, show the full output in this format:
Selected Airport – City, Country
Example: Borg El Arab Airport – Alexandria, Egypt

4. Test Dataset (Seed for Testing):
Include the following cities and airports:

Cairo, Egypt → Cairo International Airport, Almaza Airport

Alexandria, Egypt → Borg El Arab Airport

Dubai, UAE → Dubai International Airport, Al Maktoum International Airport

Istanbul, Turkey → Istanbul Airport, Sabiha Gökçen International Airport

London, UK → Heathrow Airport, Gatwick Airport, Stansted Airport

New York, USA → JFK, LaGuardia, Newark

Paris, France → Charles de Gaulle Airport, Orly Airport

Rome, Italy → Fiumicino, Ciampino

Tokyo, Japan → Haneda Airport, Narita Airport

Jeddah, Saudi Arabia → King Abdulaziz International Airport

5. Admin Panel Integration (Inside Settings Section):
Within the Admin Panel, under the Settings section, add a new management screen titled:
Manage Cities & Airports

Features:

Add / Edit / Delete Countries

Add / Edit / Delete Cities nested under each country

Add / Edit / Delete Airports nested under each city

The data created/updated here should automatically populate the From and To dropdowns on the front-end.

6. Bonus (Optional):
If available in future data, include and display IATA codes next to airport names.
