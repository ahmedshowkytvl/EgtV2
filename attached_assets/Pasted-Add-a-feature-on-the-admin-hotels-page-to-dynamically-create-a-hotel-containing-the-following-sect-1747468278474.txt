Add a feature on the /admin/hotels page to dynamically create a hotel, containing the following sections:

🏨 Basic Hotel Information:
Name

Location (Address, City, Country)

Star Rating

Guest Rating

Nearby Landmarks

I want a way to depend on Google to suggest nearby landmarks once the location field is filled.

✨ General Highlights:
This section should be linked to a table in the database.

Editable list (e.g., Great for activities, 24-hour check-in, etc.)

🚗 Transportation Options:
This section should be optional for the client.

Airport Transfer

Car Rental

Shuttle or Taxi Services

Parking

🧼 Cleanliness and Safety:
This section should be linked to a table in the database.

Daily Disinfection

Availability of Masks and Sanitizers

Hygiene Certificates or Covid Testing

🛎️ Facilities and Services:
This section should be linked to a table in the database.

Facilities can be created once (e.g., Wi-Fi, Elevator, Laundry Service, Concierge...)

When creating or editing a hotel, the user can select a group of related facilities.

There should be a Many-to-Many relationship between hotels and facilities.

🛏️ Room Amenities:
Same principle as above (e.g., Air Conditioning, Hair Dryer, Blackout Curtains, etc.)

Selected from an existing database.

🍽️ Food and Dining:
Restaurant Names

Type of Cuisine

Breakfast Options (Halal, Vegetarian, etc.)

🛌 Room Types:
Room Name

Bed Type

Size

View

Room-Specific Amenities

Price and Booking Options

❓ Frequently Asked Questions:
Stored in a separate section and should be easily addable/repeatable

💡 Technical Notes:
Use relational models

Example:

facilities table

hotels

hotel_facilities (pivot table for Many-to-Many relation)

Same logic applies to room_amenities

Support multi-language fields (Arabic + English)

Admin panel should support Add / Edit / Delete of facilities

When creating a new hotel, user can select existing facilities from a predefined list

🎯 Goal:
Make the entire system reusable, well-structured, and professionally stored in the database.
